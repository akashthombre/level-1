1) Function 1 

//Function to fetch the info of particular pokemon

var pokemonInfo = function(name){       //function decleartion and passing name as parameter

	for (x in pokemonList.pokemon){          //iterate through object and arrays

		if(pokemonList.pokemon[x].name == name){  //condition

			console.log(pokemonList.pokemon[x]);   // result display in console
		}else
    {
      // do nothing
    }
	}
}// end function

var name = window.prompt('Enter the pokemon name');   //take user input

pokemonInfo(name);  // function call


Description:

We have to fetch the information of particular pokemon, so i did the follwoing logic:

1. declared the function with name as a parameter to pass and assigned it to a variable named as pokemonInfo.
2.For iterate through object, i have used for in loop .
3.then gave a condition as 

if(pokemonList.pokemon[x].name == name){   //condition

			console.log(pokemonList.pokemon[x]);   // result display in console
		}

it will display the whole infromation of that particular pokemon as we passed the name of pokemon.
4.To take user input, we used window.prompt.
5.finally we have to call that function .
